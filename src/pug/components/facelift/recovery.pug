            p.real__desc.c-desc After a facelift, patients must follow Dr. Hubert’s post-surgical care instructions very closely. This will ensure that the recovery process is as short and comfortable as possible and involves no unexpected complications.
            p.real__desc.c-desc It will be necessary to take some time off from work following a facelift. Patients typically return to their job after one to two weeks. However, if the job requires heavy lifting or other strenuous physical activities, more time off will likely be required.
            p.real__desc.c-desc Pain-control medication may be prescribed to help with any pain or discomfort during the healing process, and cold compresses can be used to lessen bruising and swelling. As these issues fade, the patient’s full facelift results will be evident.
