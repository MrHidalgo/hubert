        p.specialties__desc.c-desc.wow.animate__animated.animate__fadeInUp When it comes to reconstructive surgery, Dr. Hubert has a special interest in breast surgery including reconstructive microsurgery. In addition to implant breast reconstruction, he routinely performs DIEP flap microsurgery for breast reconstruction. This surgery is very complex, and only a handful of surgeons across Virginia offer this advanced option for women using their own tissue to make a new breast. Dr. Hubert has quite literally performed hundreds of these operations. He has been in private practice since 2007.
