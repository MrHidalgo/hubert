        p.we__desc.c-desc.wow.animate__animated.animate__fadeInUp Be careful with other people who call themselves “cosmetic surgeons”. This can be a “buyer beware” market, and some people who advertise themselves as specializing in cosmetic surgery of a certain part of the body, are in fact, limited by their training and qualifications. For example, some people who do “cosmetic surgery” are actually dentists regulated by the state board of dentistry, not medicine.  Dr. Hubert is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, which is a member of the American Board of Medical Specialties, the gold standard for board certification of medical specialties.
